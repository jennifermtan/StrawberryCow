# StrawberryCow
A simple user-controlled game with PyGame, where the user will control the strawberry cow using left and right arrow keys.
The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by collecting "good" strawberries that will add up the score by 1,
and avoiding the "bad" strawberries that will decrease the score by 1. The user will have 15 seconds before the game ends,
with the score and time shown on top of the screen throughout the duration of the game.
